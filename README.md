## A zero-cost, zero-framework, dynamic Farcaster Frame template

### My needs for starting this were:

1. **ðŸš± Zero Framework:** Didn't want a framework baked in, and most options default to Next.js/React
2. **ðŸ†“ Zero Cost:** Frames are for experiments! Experimenting is more fruitful when it's free.
3. **ðŸ§± Stable:** The domain and its attached state should be reasonably stable over the horizon of an experiment. Replit can only give you this at cost (see above)
4. **ðŸ¤¸ Dynamic Generation:** You can get all the above pretty easy with static files, but let's be real: we want dynamism!
5. **ðŸ¤¤ Small:** and hopefully easy. Nobody to impress here.
6. **ðŸ˜Ž Cool Tech:** We want to be at the ðŸ¤¬ edge here, people!

### Example

https://warpcast.com/depatchedmode/0xecad681e

### Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)
3. Copy `sample.env` to `.env` and add:
   + your Netlify Key, for deploys: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   + a [Wield Key](https://docs.wield.co/farcaster/api() for reading Farcaster state: `WIELD_API_KEY`
4. `npm install`
5. `netlify dev`

### Testing
1. Run `netlify dev --live` will give [proxy your local machine](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/local-development/#share-a-live-development-server) to the *world* *wide* *web*.
2. Test that link in the Warpcast Embed UI: https://warpcast.com/~/developers/embeds

### Defining your Frame

We'll update with a proper docs soon, but you'll find everything you need in the `public` and `src` directories.

To add a new frame, create a `{frameName}.js` file in `/src/frames` and add it as an import to `/src/frames/index.js`. You'll find examples of dynamic (eg. rendered HTML) and static (eg. served from the public folder) frames in that directory.

### Deploying
This should be as simple as [watching a git repo for commits](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/).

You may encounter a 502 gateway error after deployment on the `/og-image` endpoint. This is a known issue with the `sharp` module this repo relies upon. We'll hopefully have this fixed by default, but for now there are workarounds. Follow this thread for fixes:

### Caveats
I am a designer larping as a dev. I invite your collaboration and feedback. Please be kind.

And please! Can we make it simpler?

### Roadmap
1. Less bad
2. More better
3. Migration to the [everywhere.computer](https://everywhere.computer)
